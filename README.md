# Elephant-Identification-and-Repelling-System
Introducing an innovative elephant identification and repelling system. Using a laser grid, it triggers real-time alerts when elephants approach. Powered by a Raspberry Pi, it sends wireless signals to emit a loud sound, gently repelling the elephants. This technology helps mitigate human-elephant conflicts and supports elephant conservation.
