# Elephant Identification and Repelling System

**Project Overview:**
- Our team introduces an innovative elephant identification system leveraging a laser grid for real-time alerts.
- The system utilizes a Raspberry Pi module for processing and wireless signal transmission.

**Key Features:**
- **Laser Grid:** Strategically placed to detect elephant presence and trigger alerts.
- **Wireless Transmission:** Raspberry Pi sends signals to activate deterrent mechanism.
- **Deterrent Mechanism:** Emits loud sound to gently repel elephants from protected areas.

**Functionality:**
- When elephants approach, the laser grid detects their presence and triggers real-time alerts.
- The Raspberry Pi module processes the alerts and sends wireless signals to the deterrent mechanism.
- The deterrent mechanism emits a loud sound to repel elephants from the area, promoting peaceful coexistence.

**Impact:**
- Offers a significant advancement in human-elephant conflict mitigation.
- Promotes peaceful coexistence and safeguards elephant populations.
- Combines advanced technology with a responsible approach for elephant conservation efforts.

**Description:**
Our team is proud to unveil our innovative elephant identification system, a solution designed to mitigate human-elephant conflicts. Leveraging a strategically placed laser grid, our system triggers real-time alerts when elephants approach protected areas. Powered by a Raspberry Pi module, the system transmits wireless signals to activate a deterrent mechanism, emitting a loud sound to gently repel elephants from the vicinity. This technology represents a significant advancement in promoting peaceful coexistence and safeguarding elephant populations.

By combining advanced technology with a responsible approach, our project offers a promising solution for elephant conservation efforts.
